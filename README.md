# Library-System
This program is designed to replicate a library web app

This is a program I call my library system build with Spring Boot. This program is designed to replicate a program a library could use for their employees and visitors. Visitors have the capability of searching for, reviewing, and reserving books. Employees can add or remove books from inventory and to check books in or out. I also incorporated a Mahout Recommender Engine to incorporate some of my machine learning practices.
